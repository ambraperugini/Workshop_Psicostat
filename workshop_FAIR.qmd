# Why FAIR?

- Growing demands for **transparency** and **reproducibility**
- Data is often hard to find, access, interpret, or reuse
- FAIR principles offer a structured solution

> "FAIR = Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable"

# Overview of FAIR

- A set of guiding principles
- Applicable across disciplines
- Aiming at **machine-readability** and referring to **data stewardship**



# Findable

**Key ideas:**

- Assign globally unique and persistent identifiers (PIDs)
- Metadata should be rich and indexed in searchable resources

**Example in practice:**

- Use DOIs for datasets
- Tag datasets with relevant keywords and metadata


# Accessible

**Key ideas:**

- Use standardized protocols (e.g., HTTP)
- Metadata remains accessible even if data is restricted

**Example in practice:**

- Publish metadata openly even if data is sensitive (e.g., clinical trials)
- Use data repositories (e.g., OSF, Zenodo)


# Interoperable

**Key ideas:**

- Use standardized vocabularies and formats
- Data should interoperate with tools and other datasets

**Example in practice:**

- Store data in open formats (CSV, JSON)
- Use standardized variable naming

# Reusable

**Key ideas:**

- Clear data usage licenses
- Rich metadata describing context, provenance

**Example in practice:**

- Add a Creative Commons license
- Include documentation, codebooks, analysis scripts

# Understanding Data Licenses

## Why it Matters

- Licenses clarify what others can legally do with your data or code

- No license? Others may not be able to reuse your work—even for research


# Common License Types

## Creative Commons (CC) — for datasets, docs, media:

- **CC0 (CC0-1.0)** — No rights reserved, public domain

- **CC-BY (CC-BY-4.0)** — Attribution required

- **CC-BY-SA (CC-BY-SA-4.0)** — Attribution + same license

 **Best for data sharing:** CC0 or CC-BY


# Open Source Licenses (GitHub-Friendly) {.smaller}

These are commonly used on GitHub for code:

- **MIT** — Simple, permissive, attribution only

- **Apache-2.0** — MIT + patent rights

- **GPL-3.0** — Must share derivative code with same license

- **BSD-2-Clause** and **BSD-3-Clause** — Similar to MIT, widely used

- **MPL-2.0** — File-level copyleft, flexible

- **Unlicense** — Public domain equivalent

 **Most GitHub projects use:** MIT, Apache-2.0, or GPL-3.0



# How to License Your Work

- Choose based on how open you want reuse to be

- Add a short `README` or metadata tag

**Example:**

```text
This dataset is licensed under CC-BY 4.0.
You are free to share and adapt it, provided you give appropriate credit.
```

Or for code:

```text
MIT License
Copyright (c) 2025 Your Name
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy...
```

# FAIR in Psychology 

- Improves **replicability** and **meta-analyses**
- Facilitates **collaboration**
- Encourages **better documentation** and data curation


# First steps to become more FAIR

- Use data repositories (e.g., OSF, Dataverse)

- Adopt metadata standards (e.g., DDI, Dublin Core)

- Publish protocols and code

- Provide clear licenses
